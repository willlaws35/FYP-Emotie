To my family and everyone at home for dealing with my obsessive ramblings of meaningless tat, for months on end.

The Sleepless Robotics Crew, for suggesting additons to the robot I do not need, but made for a damn cool extra.

Benhur Bakhtiari Bastaki, as my primary assessor and supervisor through the duration of the project.

Chris Hawkins, as my Second assessor of the project.

Luke Emery, for hosting an incredible module through the duration of the year, allowing a break from the madness.
My only hope is, he gets a full night of sleep sometime soon.
